<h2>A little bit about me</h2>
</center>


<center>
<p>Hi there, my name is Julia Grocholl. I am currently a Junior at the University of Maine and am studying finance and mathematics. <br>
I am originally from Brunswick, ME and love going back there to visit my family, dog, and two cats. <br>
I am a member of Pi Beta Phi here at UMaine. I joined as a sophomore and am so glad I did. It has given me the opportunity to be much more invloved and has lead me to lifelong friendships. <br>
In my free time I love to play around with watercolors and pastels. Although it is not part of my major, I enjoy being creative and keeping art a big part of my life. <br>
A few things that really make me happy are the beach, apple picking, animals, Christmas, cooking healthy meals, yoga, and art. <br>
I hope you learned something about me! <br>
Feel free to click on the links at the top of the page to learn a little more. </p>
