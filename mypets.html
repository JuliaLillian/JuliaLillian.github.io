<h1>My Pets</h1>
</center>

<h2>Piper</h2>
<p> This is my dog, Piper. We got him when he was a puppy, but now he is almost 3! He is a standard poodle but we shave him all one length so he looks more like a labradoodle. He is so energetic and LOVES to be cuddled.</p>

<h2>Evie</h2>
<p>This is my cat, Evie. She is almost 7 now. I believe black cats have the most personality and she reenforces this. She is so sassy but can also be a sweetheart. When I come home from college she makes it a point to sleep with me at night. If she wasn't an outdoor cat, I would bring her up to school with me for sure.</p>
